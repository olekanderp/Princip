Installing Node-RED
Getting Node-RED installed in your Raspberry Pi is quick and easy. It just takes a few commands.

Having an SSH connection established with your Raspberry Pi, enter the following commands to install Node-RED:

pi@raspberry:~ $ bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-red/raspbian-deb-package/master/resources/update-nodejs-and-nodered)
The installation should be completed after a couple of minutes.

Autostart Node-RED on boot
To automatically run Node-RED when the Pi boots up, you need to enter the following command:

pi@raspberry:~ $ sudo systemctl enable nodered.service
Now, restart your Pi so the autostart takes effect:

pi@raspberry:~ $ sudo reboot
Testing the Installation
When your Pi is back on, you can test the installation by entering the IP address of your Pi in a web browser followed by the 1880 port number:

http://YOUR_RPi_IP_ADDRESS:1880
In my case is:

http://192.168.1.98:1880
